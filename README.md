# WorldOfTanks_BattleCounter

## Why?

I wrote this program to count how many skirmish battles each of our clan members played together with a given commander. Where before I
had to spend about 2 to 3 hours for 200 battles to write down and count the battles it now only takes 30 seconds. And you could apply this
to other game modes as well. 
But for skirmishes or clan battles in general it makes the most sense because it reflects how many battles the players have actually
played with the clan.

## How do I use this power? (Instructions only for Windows)

You need to download the [WoT Replay Analyzer](http://forum.worldoftanks.eu/index.php?/topic/185348-1611-wot-replay-analyzer-wip-1-20102019/). Then put all the replays you want to analyze in a single folder. 
#### !Don't point it to your general replays folder, it can't load 5k+ replays!
Then you select all the replays (Ctrl+A) and right click, Export and then export as "Single file for all replays" and it's a ready to use
.json file!
Then you just start up the program and follow the instructions. Tada!
